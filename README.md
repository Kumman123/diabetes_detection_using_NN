# Diabetes Detection using Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to predict diabetes outcomes based on patient data. The dataset contains various health metrics, and the model is trained to classify whether a patient has diabetes (Outcome = 1) or not (Outcome = 0).

## Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of deep learning for binary classification tasks. The implemented neural network:
- Preprocesses the dataset using standardization.
- Trains a multi-layer feedforward neural network.
- Evaluates performance using accuracy metrics on both training and testing data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Diabetes Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

- **Features**: Includes 8 attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.
- **Target**: `Outcome` (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)
